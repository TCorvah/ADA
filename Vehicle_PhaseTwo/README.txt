ðŸš— Vehicle Rental Simulation â€“ Phase One

ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project simulates a vehicle rental system using Ada, where users can choose between a Standard Vehicle and a Luxury Vehicle.
After the selection, the simulation runs the respective vehicle's behavior, enforcing or warning about safety conditions depending on the vehicle type.

This is Phase One of a multi-phase project solely created by me.
It will evolve into a more advanced embedded and real-time system simulation aimed at reinforcing concepts like:
Real-time design
Concurrency
Hardware interfacing

ðŸ”„ Main Flow â€“ Phase One

Display available vehicle types for rental.
User selects a vehicle.
Default rental price  and miles per gallon is shown based on the selection.
The system simulates:
Engine Start/Stop behavior
Movement with safety checks (e.g., seatbelt, door locks)
Sensor responses based on vehicle type (Standard or Luxury)
Radar will only work for Luxury Vehicle in phase one for objecct detection
